# Tech Notes

The files here are short writeups on how to use certain command line
tools. They are in no way thoroughly written, they are just quick
notes so that at a glance, I can remember how to use certain tools with
the most important features.

I find myself using many of these for embedded systems, yet I don't spend
too much time with these, and often find myself forgetting how to use them.
